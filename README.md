# Creational Patterns Benchmark Testing

## Statement of Work:
<b>First of all, I would like to remind you that our main priority when using Design Patterns is to write a sustainable and clean code instead of gaining performance</b>.

Our aim in this project is to try to look at creational design patterns from a different perspective.
It is to try to understand how our project can affect our performance, as well as disrupting the concepts such as sustainable, clean code, etc. in the wrong use of creational design patterns.

Our main method in App.java measures the total cost of objects produced with each creational design pattern. </br>
Our main method in App2.java measures the instantaneous cost of each object produced with each creational design pattern. </br>

In order to make these observations, we wrote 2-3 concrete classes that can be produced in different ways. </br>
These classes are inside the Customer package.</br>

In the images below, there are a few examples of the graphics we get when we run our App.java class.</br>
